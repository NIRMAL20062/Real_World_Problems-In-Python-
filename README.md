In the journey of learning to code, after a point, its important for students to be able to apply these coding concepts to solve practical problems that are more relevant to real life. And one of the challenges with practical problems is that they are often vague, and a lot of assumptions need to be made while arriving at an acceptable solutions. Here is a list of coding problems that can provide students with some practice in solving such questions.

Note:that in several problems, specific values are mentioned, which you should use as a input to your function in a suitable format. The code should work even if we change the values.

Q26. A company offers discounts based on a tiered system, where each product’s discount is determined by a percentage based on its price. Write a Python program that calculates the total discounted price of a list of products. The program should take a list of product prices (eg. 50, 150, 600, 1200) and apply the respective discount to each product, then return the total discounted cost.
Q27. Imagine you’re tracking your monthly expenses and want to know how much you’re spending on each category, like groceries, rent, transportation, etc. Write a Python program that calculates the total expenses for each category and shows you where most of your money is going.

Q28. You are taking an exam with four types of questions: 10 questions are 4 marks each, 10 questions are 3 marks each, 10 questions are 2 marks each, and 5 questions are 1 mark each. For each correct answer, you receive full marks, while each incorrect answer results in a deduction of 1 mark. You answered 5 questions from the 4-mark section, 4 questions from the 3-mark section, 7 questions from the 2-mark section, and 3 questions from the 1-mark section. Out of these, 8 answers were incorrect. Calculate the total marks you achieved, your percentage score, and determine if you passed the exam, given that the passing mark is 80. Write a function that takes these numbers as input and does all the calculations to return the output.
Q29. You are given a dictionary representing the inventory of a store. The keys are the item names, and the values are tuples containing the available stock and price. Write a Python function that checks if the requested quantity of the item is available. If available, reduces the stock by the quantity purchased and returns the total price for that purchase. If not available, returns a message stating “Not enough stock.”
Q30. Create a function mask_email(email) that takes an email address and hides part of it for privacy, showing only the first two characters of the username and the domain.
